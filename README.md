# Dicee

## My Goal

The objective of this mini project is to introduce to the core programming concepts that will form the foundation of most of the apps I will build in the future. This app will represent a lot of important programming knowledge, while building a neat dice app.

## What I was created

I was created a Las Vegas dice app. I can make the die roll at the press of a button or by shaking phone. With this app in our pocket, i will be fully set up to settle any score on the go!


## What i was learn with building this mini project

* Create an app with behaviour and functionality.
* Create links between the Interface Builder files and code using IBActions and IBOutlets.
* Get familiar with the Xcode code editor.
* * Learn to use comments to annotate code.
* Understand and use Swift constants and variables.
* Understand and use collection types such as Swift arrays.
* Test and debug app with the Xcode console.
* Learned about randomisation and how to generate random numbers in Swift.

Thank's !
